                        <h3>How does the app blocker work?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Blokki uses Apple's Family Controls and DeviceActivity APIs to block apps at the system level. Once you select apps to block, they remain blocked even when the Blokki app is closed.

                            Yes! You can unlock apps temporarily by spending coins earned from completing habits. Unlock durations range from 1 minute to 2 hours.

                            Yes, the app blocker works at the iOS system level and continues to function even when Blokki is not running. It uses DeviceActivity extensions that run in the background.
